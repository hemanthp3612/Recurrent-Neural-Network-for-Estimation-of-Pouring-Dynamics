# Recurrent-Neural-Network-for-Estimation-of-Pouring-Dynamics
Implemented Recurrent Neural Network architectures to predict the weight of cup using motion sequence dataset. This dataset was analyzed to identify patterns and then pre-processed to achieve better performance and precision. Similarly, this algorithm can be used to predict movements in currency rate and stock indexes with time.
